Open Source Social Media Profile Protocol/Standard

## About

The way we connect with each other on the internet is becoming controlled by
social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. We need to return to
adopting open standards that we control (like email and RSS feeds).

This project aims to define an open standard that provides the following
features:

* Flexibility - Provided by a service or platform you choose, or self hosted.
* Portability - You own your data, and can migrate it to any alternative
  platform.
* Security - Uses [OAuth 2.0] to authorize disclosure of profile data
